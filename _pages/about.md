I'm a PhD candidate in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before Yale, I worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University in Canada (just outside of Vancouver, BC).

I study social cognition (e.g., how we infer other peoples' motives), motivated cognition (e.g., how moral concerns bias our inferences and memories), and prosocial motivation (why we help others). My work draws on theory and methods from social psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. To learn more about my work, check out my [publications](https://carlsonrw.github.io/publications/) page.
